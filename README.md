# FileSplitter

#### Why
I normally keep `test` files for languages I'm using so I have quick access to short snippets of code. This file splitter allows me to have individual files to use in my projects easily.

After cleaning up a lot of the code in the `example/test.rb` file (there was a bunch of frivolous snippets), I ran it against the file splitter.

##### Example

`SplitCodeSection.new "#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/example/test.rb"`
